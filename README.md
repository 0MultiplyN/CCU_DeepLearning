## About the HW folder
- Inside this 'hw' folder are the assignments from the deep learning course 
  I took during my studies in the Department of Computer Science.
### About the assignment
- The assignments involve practicing the use of commonly used frameworks and models in deep learning, 
  including TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas, among others.
- Through these assignments, I familiarized myself with the course content, 
  which will be valuable for tackling more complex problems 
  in future deep learning projects and research.
